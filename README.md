# The-Invisible-Hand
A revamp/restart of my [CC](https://github.com/NatAug62/CC) project. The CC project was getting too messy and cluttered for me and I was in the middle of refactoring it anyways. This repo will (hopefully) be organized much better and the code will (hopefully) be more organized, efficient, and resilient.

## Branch Naming Convention
Branches will use the naming convention `tag-issueNum`. Each branch will be associate with an issue, which will be identified by the branch name. For example, a branch created for the issue [Dynamic TCP/UDP Connection](https://github.com/NatAug62/The-Invisible-Hand/issues/1) would be named `feature-01`.
